# Meeting Notes

## Meeting 1 (18th July, 2021) - Exploring the problem space

### Key Takeaways

* Need to answer 6 questions (5W1H) about the problem before starting to address it
  * How big is the problem?
  * Why is it a problem? - Root cause analysis
  * Who is the problem affecting?
  * What will change if we solve the problem?
  * Where are we currently and where we intend to reach? - Identifying the gap between Status Quo and ideal situation
  * When of the problem? - Time related aspects (Since when is this a problem, is this regular, seasonal or transient, and how long will it take to address it)?

> Also look at the SMART framework: Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant and Time bound.

* Issues with existing media channels - social media or other channels like Television, news etc.
  * Information is very diffused, leads to information overload
  * Important problems often get overshadowed by posts made by popular accounts
  * Lack of updates on the status of a problem posted
  * Misuse of comment space for self-promotion, use by malicious actors and cyber-bullying
  * Lack of actionability and clarity on actions required and outcomes to expect
  * Hard to separate signal from noise
  * Misinformation - hard to know which posts are genuine
  * Lack of transparency and 2-way communication

### Next Steps

* Building a basic pipeline to get inputs from social media channels (ingest using twitter api), storing in a database, scheduling requests and allocating to whatsapp accounts (send message via api)
  * Setting up a mongodb database to receive input from twitter api
  * Need to perform analysis on twitter data extracted from api
  * Create a dummy mongodb database and send message through whatsapp api
  * Identifying relevant public data sources and relevant points of contact (people and organizations, both)
  * Literature survey on citizen engagement in addressing social issues
